# BUILder - Social Platform for Hackers & Builders

BUILder is a social platform running on Base that allows anyone to find builders to network and collaborate at hackathons and tech events across the globe.

## Problem Statement

The app addresses two key problems in today's networking platforms:

1. **Self-reported data**: Most platforms rely on user-reported data, which can be inaccurate or incomplete.
2. **Time-consuming data acquisition**: Collecting non-self-reported data is often a slow and tedious process.

## Solution

BUILder aggregates verified, on-chain reputation data to provide users with quick and reliable matches. It offers a gamified and smooth experience, making networking fun and efficient for hackathon participants and builders.

### Key Features:

- **üîé Discover Builders Like Tinder**: Swipe "Like" or "Pass" on builders based on shared interests. Build strong hackathon teams by finding complementary skills.
  
- **üí´ Real On-Chain Data**: Access a builder's interests, skills, knowledge, and more through aggregated and verified data, ensuring that connections are valuable.
  
- **ü§ù Match Gallery**: Keep track of your past matches for future networking opportunities.
  
- **üîì Secure Matching Mechanism**: Builders are refunded only after meeting in real life, secured through a dynamic QR code that both parties scan.
  
- **üí∞ Extra Rewards for Winning Teams**: Builders who form teams through BUILder and win a hackathon will receive additional rewards from BUILder's treasury.

## How Does the Incentive Mechanism Work?

- Users must pay **$5** to cast a "Like", incentivizing real, meaningful connections.
- All funds from likes are held in a smart contract escrow (`buildercontract.sol`).
- When two builders match, they meet in real life and scan their QRs to release the funds (minus a **10% fee** for BUILder).
- If they don't meet before the event's due date, **100%** of the funds are forfeited to the protocol.
- Builders who match, form a hackathon team, and win prizes will be rewarded with an extra bonus from BUILder's treasury.

**Note:** Event deadlines and builder success in hackathons are reviewed manually by the BUILder team in collaboration with event organizers.
