BUILder is a social platform that runs on scroll, that lets anyone find builders to network and hack together at specific events across the globe.

The app solves 2 main problems:

- Data nowadays is self reported in most platforms.

- Not self-reported data is usually time consuming to acquire.

BUILder aggregates rich reputation data from onchain sources to make matches quick and verifiables, while providing a gamefied, smooth, and fun experience to the users.

Main features:

🔎 Discover Builders as if you are on Tinder: "Like or pass" builders based on similar interest. Complement eachother and Build winning hackathon teams.

💫 See real aggregaed data: Check each builder interests, skills, knowledge and more useful info to determine if it's worth networking with them.

🤝 Match gallery: Have a track of all your past matches for future events.

🔓 Secure Matching Mechanism: Get reefunded only after meeting IRL with builders. This is secured via a regenerative QR that builders need to scan.

💰 Rewards for winners: IF builders that matched via BUILder, win a prize at a hackathon, BUILder treasury will give them extra rewards on top.



-- HOW DOES INCENTIVE MECHANISM WORKS? --

All users that "likes" need to pay $5 to cast their likes, this is because we want to incentivise real connections.

All $ coming from likes between different builders will go to buildercontract.sol, an scrow that will save all the money income from builders.

Once 2 builders match, they will need to meet IRL to scan their QRs so the scrow will give them back all the money (-10% fee for BUILder).

If the 2 builders matched but didn't meet IRL before the event's due date, the 100% of the funds will remain on the protocol, meaning a total lose for the builders.

If builders match, make team for hackathon, and win prizes, they will get rewarded with an extra amount from BUILder treasury as a compensation.

Note: Due date event and know if a builder won a prize, is reviewed manually by BUILder team in collab with the evetn/hackathon teams thanks to our strategic partnerships.



-- DATA ENDPOINTS --

- ENS + Set PFP
- NFTs -> Curated list based on valuable and meaningful connections

We use the Talent Protocol API to get most of the user data, since they are the biggest and most reliable source of trust when it comes to onchain reputation.
